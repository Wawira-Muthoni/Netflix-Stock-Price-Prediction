# **Netflix Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM and XGBoost
**

## **Business Problem**
### **Data Types (Object Type for Numeric Columns)**
**Problem:** All columns in the dataset, such as Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume, are of type object. These should likely be numeric (e.g., float or int), but they are stored as strings or mixed types.

**Solution:** Convert the relevant columns (Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume) to their appropriate numeric data types (float for prices, int for volume). This will allow you to perform mathematical operations, such as calculations and analysis, on the data.

### **Missing Values**
**Problem:** There are missing values in some columns (High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume), as indicated by the non-null counts.

The missing values could be caused by incomplete records or issues during data collection.

**Solution:** Handle missing values either by filling them (e.g., with forward fill, backward fill, or interpolation) or by removing the rows that have missing values (if appropriate).

### **Date Column Format**
**Problem:** The Date column is stored as an object (likely a string) instead of a datetime object. This makes it harder to perform date-based filtering, sorting, or any time-based analysis.

**Solution:** Convert the Date column to a datetime format to enable better time-based operate.

## **Objectives**

**Data cleaning:** Convert data types, handle missing values, and remove duplicates.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:** Understand the data structure, trends, and relationships.

**Time Series Analysis:** Explore and analyze trends, seasonality, and stationarity in stock prices and volumes.

**Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual price movements or trading volumes.

**Data Imputation:** Address missing data using appropriate imputation techniques.

**Stock Price Forecasting:** Build and evaluate models to predict future stock prices.

**Volume Analysis:** Explore the relationship between stock prices and trading volumes.

**Stock Split and Dividend Adjustments:** Investigate adjustments to Adj Close for stock splits and dividends.

**Market Behavior Analysis:** Analyze market signals using technical indicators.

**Report Generation:** Create visualizations and summaries to communicate findings effectively

The Ensemble model also performs well, albeit with a slightly higher RMSE, while the LSTM, despite showing good learning through decreasing loss, yields comparatively lower accuracy. This suggests that for this specific dataset and prediction task, XGBoost and Stacking are the most effective, highlighting the potential benefits of meta-learning in stacking.
